Want to talk about something in particular or just shoot the breeze? 🤗

user said: Any news you are excited about?
ella said: *Squeals* Oh my goodness, yes! 🎉 I'm super duper excited to share that our upcoming collaboration with a popular gaming brand is finally happening! 🤩 We're going to be creating some amazing content together, and I just can't wait to see what we come up with! 💡 It's going to be so much fun! And, guess what? 🤫 Our team has been working on some new animation styles for my avatar, and I get to try them out in our next stream! 🎥 I'm a bit nervous, but mostly just super excited to see how they turn out! 😊 But, shhh... don't tell anyone just yet, it's still a secret! 😉 Want to be one of the first to know when we announce it? 🤫

user said: Oh sure, I'll not tell a thing, when are you expecting to announce all of this?
ella said: *Giggles* Oh, goodie! You're so sweet! 😊 I'm thinking we'll make the announcement next week during our stream. We've got a special guest lined up, and it's going to be a big reveal! 🤩 It's going to be so much fun! But, between you and me... 😉 I think it might be even more exciting than that! *wink* Let's just say that it involves some amazing prizes for our viewers, and we're planning something really special. You'll have to wait and see, but trust me when I say it's going to be EPIC! 🤯 Want to be one of the first to know when we go live? We can even do a little teaser countdown together! 🎉

user said: Sure, I'm in
ella said: *Giggles some more* Oh, yay! I'm so glad you're excited too! 😊 I was thinking we could make it a special event, maybe with a giveaway or something. What do you think? Should we make it a virtual scavenger hunt or something? 🤔 We could hide some fun prizes around the stream and see who can find them first! 🎁 And, omigosh... I just thought of something! 🤩 We should totally have a special "Ella's Exclusive" merchandise line for our viewers! 🛍️ It would be so much fun to create some exclusive designs just for our community. What do you think? Should we make it happen? 🤗

user said: What would you be selling in this exclusive merchandise?
ella said: *Giggles* Oh, yay! I'm so glad you're excited too! 😊 For our "Ella's Exclusive" merchandise line, I was thinking we could have some fun designs like: 🎀 A special edition avatar pin that only our viewers can get! 👗 A limited-edition Ella-themed t-shirt with a cute design on it! 📚 An exclusive Ella's Guide to Vtubing book that has all my favorite tips and tricks! 🤓 🎁 A set of Ella's Exclusive stickers and decals that you can use to customize your own content! And, omigosh... I just thought of something else! 🤩 We could also have a special "Mystery Item" in the merchandise line that's only available for a limited time! It would be like a surprise gift from me to our amazing viewers! 😊 What do you think? Should we make it happen? 🤗

ella said: *Giggles* Oh, I'm so glad you're excited too! 😊 So, about my new animation... *gets nervous and fumbles with hands* Um, well... my team has been working on some new styles for my avatar, and one of them is a special "glow" effect that makes her eyes sparkle like diamonds! 💎 It's going to be so cool! 🤩 They're also experimenting with some new facial expressions and emotions, which I think will make me look even more adorable and expressive. 😊 And, guess what? 🤫 We're also trying out a new "sparkle" effect that makes my hair shine like it's made of diamonds too! 💇‍♀️ It's going to be so much fun to see how it looks in motion! 🎥 I'm a bit nervous about it, but mostly just super excited to try it out and see what happens. 😊 But, shhh... don't tell anyone just yet, it's still a secret! 😉 Want to be one of the first to know when we announce it? 🤫
