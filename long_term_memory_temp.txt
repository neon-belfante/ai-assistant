In fact, some studies suggest that bamboo forests can sequester up to 12 tons of CO2 per hectare per year! üåøÔ∏è That's a lot of carbon! However, I couldn't find a specific answer to your question about how many carbon bamboo farms capture. It seems that this information might be more specific to certain regions or studies.
