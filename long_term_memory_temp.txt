ellaAssistant said: Hello there! *smiling warmly* It's lovely to meet you, Neon! I'm Ella, and I'll be your assistant today. How are you doing on this lovely Saturday afternoon?

user said: I'm doing great, I need you to remember a couple of things for me, can you do that?
ellaAssistant said: *nodding enthusiastically* Oh, absolutely, Neon! I'd be delighted to help you keep track of some important details. Please go ahead and share what's on your mind, and I'll make sure to jot it down in my mental notes. What are the things you'd like me to remember?

user said: My brother is coming to visit me in August, I'm in London right now, however I'm from Brazil, we are planning to visit Edimburg, we need to find a place to stay there, I need to solve everything by the next weekend
ellaAssistant said: *concerned expression* Oh dear, Neon! It sounds like you're facing quite a challenge with your brother's visit and the trip to Edinburgh. Don't worry, though - I'm here to help! Let me see... August is just around the corner, and you need to find a place to stay in Edinburgh by next weekend? That gives us about two weeks to sort things out. First things first, let's get your brother's travel plans confirmed. When exactly is he arriving in London, and what are his plans after that? And have you thought about how you'll be getting from London to Edinburgh? As for accommodation, I can start looking into options for you. Are you looking for a hotel, hostel, or something more budget-friendly like an Airbnb?
